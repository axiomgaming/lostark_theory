Gate 2:-4:     KLC &gt; KLC 18 &gt; LOS 30 &gt; KLC 12 &gt; LOS 18
Support:     Master of Spear 30

## Gate 1

#### 55HP
- 55hp: just do stagger and eat ball at right timing (mech starts when boss starts chanting)
- Follow the correct ball (red/blue) around and eat before boss makes big attack

#### 25HP
- Should destroy ball Blue/White/Orange sequence and follow the safe area around

## Gate 2
Watch the “eyes” on person and drop on the outside like vykas poop (phase effects: 10% damage buff/CC player/CC player + big range CC)

Stagger pattern: head always reflect

#### 55HP
- Phase 1 ~55hp: Break
- Phase 2 55~30hp: Dodge electric patterns and don’t fall to the bottom or you take big damage (time stop = bad) 
- Watch for spear on player, can die at this phase from falling off map
- Phase 3 30~0hp: reduction to damage when changing to this phase (watch for boss speaking)

## Gate 3
- Bring sacred charms
- Red &gt; Green, Green &gt; Blue, Blue &gt; Red

#### 60HP
- 11,1,6 clock and eat sequentially clockwise (SUP give shield here)
- Eat 6 balls each by eating and rotating counter clockwise (only 3 people do it) then boss looks at a direction (symbol appears under their feet too). Go clockwise of that direction and kill the color there.
- Space bar mech: you need to do the last space bar when the black appears. Tips:
  -    Watch for purify rune
  -    Cleanse before mech so you start fresh
  -    Don’t cleanse during the mech…
- 40hp: Counter twice near the 11, 1, 6 clock positions (then positions change for 2nd counter)
- 20hp: Fail = boss heal
- Positions: 1 inside, 1 mid, 2 outside
- Red &gt; Green &gt; Blue &gt; Red  (inside red, so destroy blue)

## Gate 4
- Rec Items: Timestop + Flame grenade (2 people fire, 2 people dark)
- After phase 2, you can give damage to boss with special buff
- Don’t hit mirror head side (your hp becomes 1) (looks like yellow energy shield in front of boss_
- At 160,120,80,40,20 boss uses “big pattern” which CC’s+big damage - AVOID

#### ~180hp:
- At 180 Fly and does some damage (just avoid)
#### 180~60hp:
- At 140: shooting laser gimmick (no clue…)
- At 100hp: (most difficult pattern, easier with less people) eat orbs???
- At 60hp: ping the spots? Stagger at said spot? Get barrier?
