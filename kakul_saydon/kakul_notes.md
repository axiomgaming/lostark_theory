# Kakul Saydon Cheatsheet

## Mayhem Gauge

Like Vykas your character has a Mayhem gauge which fills when you get hit. 

At 50%:

- Bar turns red
- After a short delay 4 lasers will fire from your feet
- Players hit with laser gain aura which increases other players' mayhem gauge

At 100% you turn into a clown:

- Takes additional damage
- Adds 1 stack of 3% damage reduction to the boss (cleanse with Innana Esther)
- **Q**: Throws bomb which gives decreases defense (applies to both boss and players)
- **W**: Play trumpet, creating a short-lived blue aura around the transformed player. Players inside range reduce mayhem, outside gain mayhem.
- **E**: Spawn gift box which may be destroyed (including with Q), leaving behind an ether. Player who takes the ether reduces mayhem,
  but creates an explosion around them which increases other players' gauge. 

## Gate 1

Players have a playing card suit overhead. Throughout the fight boss will spawn a mystery box which will either drop
a bomb (which must be destroyed before it explodes) or a heart/club/spade/diamond shaped ether which can be eaten by
the corresponding player to reduce mayhem. Wrong player taking the ether results in explosion giving large amount of gauge.

#### 130: Stagger Check

Purple shield spawns either front/back or front alone. Avoid directing damage into purple reflect shield. Stagger boss.

#### 110: Find Saydon (Lights Out)

Players stand at x3+1. Each of the 4 Saydons will gesture with either a Heart or Confetti. There will be either 3 hearts
or 1 heart in total. 

- Players with Heart should ping their location.
- If there are 3 pings, look to the 4th (ping-less) location.
- If there is 1 ping, look at it.

#### 85: Dance

![Poses](https://i.imgur.com/ZdNqD8p.png)

Players become clows with 4 skills. QWER poses are randomly arranged.

- Players stand on their card symbols.
- If Saydon does a pose facing the players, they must match.
- If Saydon poses facing **away**, the players must **NOT** match his pose.

#### 60: Stagger Check (repeated)

#### 50: Roulette

Roulette wheel will appear with 8 wedges. Each wedge has one of the card symbols as well as a lined/solid background.
Players have cards over their heads matching this combination of patterns and must stand on the corresponding wedge.

- Heart and Diamond are always opposite wedges, as are club and spade.
- Line backgrounds are always opposite wedges, as are solids.
- Therefore if say you need club with lines but find spade with lines, you're 180 degrees from the correct position.

#### 30: Find Saydon (again)

#### Other Mechanics

- Dice: 3 players rooted, one player kites the cards the boss fires to the corresponding player. Players should group up
  at south side, middle distance from boss but spaced apart.
- Roulette: Stand on the quarter of the wheel with symbol matching your card.
- Circus ball donut mechanic: Balls will fall and split, spawning donut floor shapes. Dodge them. Timestop and swiftness
  robes help.
- Flamethrower tower: Kill it before it does a Medusa. Fire spins in clockwise direction, avoid it because of gauge.
- Red/yellow bomb: Boss briefly holds either a red or yellow bomb, then spin-dashes like Valtan. After spin, he will
  hit the ground with his staff creating an X (red) or + (yellow) shaped explosion, followed by an outside-inside safe
  explosion (like Vykas).
- Flame ring: Boss sidesteps and targets a random player, breathing fire and spawning flamethrow rings at random. Dodge.
- Fear laser: Long charge before laser is fired, fearing hit players. Dodge.
- Pigeons: Boss removes hat and disappears, teleporting to a random player and firing high speed pigeon missiles. Dodge at right/rear of boss.
- Circus ball: **Counterable**. Like Seto, boss jumps on ball and follows a random player. Kite or shield.
