# Kakul Saydon Cheatsheet

![The dichotomy of ~~~man~~~ clown](https://i.imgur.com/d3XgStI.png)

## Mayhem Gauge

Like Vykas your character has a Mayhem gauge which fills when you get hit. 

At 50%:

- Bar turns red
- After a short delay 4 lasers will fire from your feet
- Players hit with laser gain aura which increases other players' mayhem gauge

At 100% you turn into a clown:

- Takes additional damage
- Adds 1 stack of 3% damage reduction to the boss (cleanse with Innana Ester)
- **Q**: Throws bomb which gives decreases defense (applies to both boss and players)
- **W**: Play trumpet, creating a short-lived blue aura around the transformed player. Players inside range reduce mayhem, outside gain mayhem.
- **E**: Spawn gift box which may be destroyed (including with Q), leaving behind an ether. Player who takes the ether reduces mayhem,
  but creates an explosion around them which increases other players' gauge. 

## Gate 1

**Timestop Potion, Swiftness Robe, Whirlwind Grenade**

Players have a playing card suit overhead. Throughout the fight boss will spawn a mystery box which will either drop
a bomb (which must be destroyed before it explodes) or a heart/club/spade/diamond shaped ether which can be eaten by
the corresponding player to reduce mayhem. Wrong player taking the ether results in explosion giving large amount of gauge.

- 130: Stagger
- 110: Find Saydon (Lights Out)
- 85: Dance Time
- 60: Stagger Check
- 50: Roulette
- 30: Find Saydon (Lights Out)

#### 130/60: Stagger Check

![1 shields](https://i.imgur.com/zfeovKh.png) ![2 shields](https://i.imgur.com/tyt9v1f.png)

Purple shield spawns either front/back or front alone. Avoid directing damage into purple reflect shield. Stagger boss.

#### 110/30: Find Saydon (Lights Out)

Players dodge orbs and stand at x3+1. Each of the 4 Saydons will gesture with either a Heart or Confetti. There will be either 3 hearts
or 1 heart in total. 

- Players with Heart should ping their location.
- If there are 3 pings, look to the 4th (ping-less) location.
- If there is 1 ping, look at it.

#### 85: Dance Time

![Poses](https://i.imgur.com/ZdNqD8p.png)

Players become clows with 4 skills. QWER poses are randomly arranged.

- Players stand on their card symbols.
- If Saydon does a pose facing the players, they must match.
- If Saydon poses facing **away**, the players must **NOT** match his pose.

#### 50: Roulette

Roulette wheel will appear with 8 wedges, spinning 3x. Each wedge has one of the card symbols as well as a lined/solid 
background. Players have cards over their heads matching this combination of patterns and must stand on the 
corresponding wedge.

- Heart and Diamond are always opposite wedges, as are club and spade.
- Line backgrounds are always opposite wedges, as are solids.
- Therefore if say you need club with lines but find spade with lines, you're 180 degrees from the correct position.

#### Other Mechanics

- Roulette: Stand on the wedge with symbol matching your card.
- Adds: Spawns soldiers. Kill them before they gain aura.
- Dice: 3 players rooted, one player kites the cards the boss fires to the corresponding player. Players should group up
  at south side, middle distance from boss but spaced apart from each other. Kiter may benefit from speed. Ester Inanna
  makes it so you only need 1 successful match.
- Circus ball donut mechanic: Balls will fall and split, spawning donut floor shapes. Dodge them. Timestop and swiftness
  robes help.
- Flamethrower tower: Kill it before it does a Medusa. Fire spins in clockwise direction, avoid it because of gauge.
- Red/yellow bomb: Boss briefly holds either a red or yellow bomb, then spin-dashes like Valtan. After spin, he will
  hit the ground with his staff creating an X (if red bomb) or + (yellow bomb) shaped explosion, followed by an outside-inside safe
  explosion pair (like Vykas).
- Flame ring: Boss sidesteps and targets a random player, breathing fire and spawning flamethrow rings at random. Dodge.
- Fear laser: Long charge before laser is fired, fearing hit players. Dodge.
- Pigeons: Boss removes hat and disappears, teleporting to a random player and firing high speed pigeon missiles. Dodge at right/rear of boss.
- Circus ball: **Counterable**. Like Seto, boss jumps on ball and follows a random player. Kite or shield.

## Gate 2

**Timestop Potion, Sacred Charm**

After Saydon appears, yellow attacks knock you. Don't fall off.

- 125: Saydon Appears
- 110: Mayhem Fog
- 95: Card Flip
- 80: Maze
- 55: Velganos Pizza
- 25: Card Flip

#### 125: Saydon Appears

Dodge his pigeons, AOEs, etc. throughout the fight. See 'Other patterns'


#### 110: Mayhem Fog

- Kakul teleports to the middle while Saydon casts Medusa. Players look away.
- 4 safe spots to avoid death from high-damage fog DOT.
- **Red** safe spot: **2** players
- **Blue** safe spot: **1** player

![Safe Spots](https://i.imgur.com/RCV8sQX.png)

#### 95/25: Card Flip

![Pattern A](https://i.imgur.com/zQ9RQiX.png)

- 7 cards spawn with Kakul under one of them
- One player is the hammer target
- 3 Hammer smashes happen. If the hammer hits Kakul you pass. If not it shows the hit card and 2 neighbors.
- Hit either 2nd or 2nd-to-last card first.
- If no Kakul, go to the other (e.g., 2nd first then 2nd-to-last next). After this step you have seen 6/7 cards.
- If still no Kakul, he's in the middle.

Alternate pattern for slower movers:

![Pattern B](https://i.imgur.com/qytOOBt.png)

- Can do this pattern either left-to-right or reversed. Assuming left-to-right:
- Hammer the 2nd card.
- Hammer the 5th card.
- If no kakul, it's the 7th card.

#### 80: Maze

- Kakul makes a hole in reality.
- All 4 players have toy hammer with normal attack and **Q** jump attack.
- One player destroys statue in middle to get **Overview**. Park your character near the spawn in a safe cubby to avoid Seto.
- Overview player can ping to guide others.
- Other 3 players get card symbol and must bop the corresponding card warriors 3x to get buff stack, while dodging Seto as he goes vertically and horizontally
- Getting hit by Seto resets your stacks.
- After killing 3 card warriors, exit gates appear at 1:30 left, move to corresponding gate.
- Discord screen share to cheese.

#### 55: Velganos Pizza

- Kakul teleports to the middle and does 3 velganos pizzas
- Stars around boss indicate the direction (counter/clockwise) for **all 3** before the first one
- Starts with safe zone at rear
- 8 possible patterns: RRR, LLL, RLR, LRL, RRL, LLR, RLL, LRR 
- Middle of last pizza turn, Seto will start to smash randomly chosen player with hammer AOE. Players should dodge while making
  sure the AOE hits Kakul to prevent wipe. 
- Ester Innana to reduce cost of errors
- Timestop
