# Kakul Saydon Cheatsheet

![The dichotomy of ~~~man~~~ clown](https://i.imgur.com/d3XgStI.png)

## Mayhem Gauge

Like Vykas your character has a Mayhem gauge which fills when you get hit. 

At 50%:

- Bar turns red
- After a short delay 4 lasers will fire from your feet
- Players hit with laser gain aura which increases other players' mayhem gauge

At 100% you turn into a clown:

- Takes additional damage
- Adds 1 stack of 3% damage reduction to the boss (cleanse with Innana Esther)
- **Q**: Throws bomb which gives decreases defense (applies to both boss and players)
- **W**: Play trumpet, creating a short-lived blue aura around the transformed player. Players inside range reduce mayhem, outside gain mayhem.
- **E**: Spawn gift box which may be destroyed (including with Q), leaving behind an ether. Player who takes the ether reduces mayhem,
  but creates an explosion around them which increases other players' gauge. 

## Gate 1

**Timestop Potion, Swiftness Robe, Whirlwind Grenade**

Players have a playing card suit overhead. Throughout the fight boss will spawn a mystery box which will either drop
a bomb (which must be destroyed before it explodes) or a heart/club/spade/diamond shaped ether which can be eaten by
the corresponding player to reduce mayhem. Wrong player taking the ether results in explosion giving large amount of gauge.

- 130: Stagger
- 110: Find Saydon (Lights Out)
- 85: Dance Time
- 60: Stagger Check
- 50: Roulette
- 30: Find Saydon (Lights Out)

#### 130/60: Stagger Check

![1 shields](https://i.imgur.com/zfeovKh.png) ![2 shields](https://i.imgur.com/tyt9v1f.png)

Purple shield spawns either front/back or front alone. Avoid directing damage into purple reflect shield. Stagger boss.

#### 110/30: Find Saydon (Lights Out)

Players dodge orbs and stand at x3+1. Each of the 4 Saydons will gesture with either a Heart or Confetti. There will be either 3 hearts
or 1 heart in total. 

- Players with Heart should ping their location.
- If there are 3 pings, look to the 4th (ping-less) location.
- If there is 1 ping, look at it.

#### 85: Dance Time

![Poses](https://i.imgur.com/ZdNqD8p.png)

Players become clows with 4 skills. QWER poses are randomly arranged.

- Players stand on their card symbols.
- If Saydon does a pose facing the players, they must match.
- If Saydon poses facing **away**, the players must **NOT** match his pose.

#### 50: Roulette

Roulette wheel will appear with 8 wedges, spinning 3x. Each wedge has one of the card symbols as well as a lined/solid 
background. Players have cards over their heads matching this combination of patterns and must stand on the 
corresponding wedge.

- Heart and Diamond are always opposite wedges, as are club and spade.
- Line backgrounds are always opposite wedges, as are solids.
- Therefore if say you need club with lines but find spade with lines, you're 180 degrees from the correct position.

#### Other Mechanics

- Roulette: Stand on the wedge with symbol matching your card.
- Adds: Spawns soldiers. Kill them before they gain aura.
- Dice: 3 players rooted, one player kites the cards the boss fires to the corresponding player. Players should group up
  at south side, middle distance from boss but spaced apart from each other. Kiter may benefit from speed. Esther Inanna
  makes it so you only need 1 successful match.
- Circus ball donut mechanic: Balls will fall and split, spawning donut floor shapes. Dodge them. Timestop and swiftness
  robes help.
- Flamethrower tower: Kill it before it does a Medusa. Fire spins in clockwise direction, avoid it because of gauge.
- Red/yellow bomb: Boss briefly holds either a red or yellow bomb, then spin-dashes like Valtan. After spin, he will
  hit the ground with his staff creating an X (if red bomb) or + (yellow bomb) shaped explosion, followed by an outside-inside safe
  explosion pair (like Vykas).
- Flame ring: Boss sidesteps and targets a random player, breathing fire and spawning flamethrow rings at random. Dodge.
- Fear laser: Long charge before laser is fired, fearing hit players. Dodge.
- Pigeons: Boss removes hat and disappears, teleporting to a random player and firing high speed pigeon missiles. Dodge at right/rear of boss.
- Circus ball: **Counterable**. Like Seto, boss jumps on ball and follows a random player. Kite or shield.

![Pattern A](https://i.imgur.com/zQ9RQiX.png)

- 7 cards spawn with Kakul under one of them
- One player is the hammer target
- 3 Hammer smashes happen. If the hammer hits Kakul you pass. If not it shows the hit card and 2 neighbors.
- Hit either 2nd or 2nd-to-last card first.
- If no Kakul, go to the other (e.g., 2nd first then 2nd-to-last next). After this step you have seen 6/7 cards.
- If still no Kakul, he's in the middle.

Alternate pattern for slower movers:

![Pattern B](https://i.imgur.com/qytOOBt.png)

- Can do this pattern either left-to-right or reversed. Assuming left-to-right:
- Hammer the 2nd card.
- Hammer the 5th card.
- If no Kakul, it's the 7th card.

#### 80: Maze

- Kakul makes a hole in reality.
- All 4 players have toy hammer with normal attack and **Q** jump attack.
- One player destroys statue in middle to get **Overview**. Park your character near the spawn in a safe cubby to avoid Seto.
- Overview player can ping to guide others.
- Other 3 players get card symbol and must bop the corresponding card warriors 3x to get buff stack, while dodging Seto as he goes vertically and horizontally
- Getting hit by Seto resets your stacks.
- After killing 3 card warriors, exit gates appear at 1:30 left, move to corresponding gate.
- Discord screen share to cheese.

#### 55: Velganos Pizza

- Kakul teleports to the middle and does 3 velganos pizzas
- Stars around boss indicate the direction (counter/clockwise) for **all 3** before the first one
- Starts with safe zone at rear
- 8 possible patterns: RRR, LLL, RLR, LRL, RRL, LLR, RLL, LRR 
- Middle of last pizza turn, Seto will start to smash randomly chosen player with hammer AOE. Players should dodge while making
  sure the AOE hits Kakul to prevent wipe. 
- Esther Innana to reduce cost of errors
- Timestop

  ![Mario #4](https://i.imgur.com/pt3OWQO.png)

#### Showtime

 - Begins with teleport-to-center and cutscene.
 - Dodge donuts (midrange safest).
 - 2 players have crosshairs. They spawn flame pools underfoot periodically, which slow and burn.
 - Cone shaped aoe centered on Saydon, like Valtan. Dodge.
 - Saydon will, after donut patterns, do a spinning guns attack sort of like the Ghost Ship boss. Start at front or back then
move in a circle to avoid.
 - After 2nd spinning guns, large bomb will spawn. Player controlling the cone must aim it so it hits the bomb. 
 - After the first bomb, the pattern repeats with a second bomb opposite the first.
 - After bombs, 3 donuts are mid then far/close then mid safe.
 - Final mechanic: 4 large crosshairs, each targeting a different player. Strategies are to group up and kite together
 with a marching flag, or separate cardinally and rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise.
 - During large crosshairs, large AOEs on ground must be dodged.
 - Esther Innana for the final mech.
 - 3rd Mario player may need to intentionally get hit by yellow ring AOEs for Mayhem gauge.

#### Other patterns
 
 - Hooks: Starting with 2nd mario, hooks will spawn that move diagonally from top left to bottom right or top right to botoom left.

![HP Flip Indicator](https://i.imgur.com/8X8Z2uU.png)

 - HP Flip: Between Marios 1-4 players may be given an HP flip curse. After the curse expires your HP bar flips, so players
 intentionally take damage from the flame wall at the map edge.
 - Clown Face: On even curse applications, boss will teleport to middle and deal damage based on the number of
 reduction buffs he has from players transforming into clowns. 3+ explosions is bad, 4 is a wipe. Esther Innana removes
 his buff. Players are silenced so must shield up beforehand.
 - Albion: Saydon will create a cross-safed explosion, then jump to nearest player and do a fork-shaped explosion twice,
 then a final large yellow AOE with small wedge safe areas.
 - Seto: Creates several circular AOEs followed by 2 donut AOEs.
 - Fear Laser: Like 1st gate but rotates in a large half circle. Use bard Guardian Tune beforehand if possible.

## Gate 3 Bingo

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br24BBCeufI]

- Saydon has 77 bars of health. Each bingo deals x13.
- Two initial skulls in the 5x5 square board.
- Approx. every 30 seconds one player get a bomb indicator, and after 5 seconds the bomb will drop on that player's square.
- Bombs flip skulls to empty and vice versa, in a plus shape centered on their drop point. The goal is to get 5 skulls 
in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on every 3rd drop.
- At every 3rd bomb drop Saydon will teleport to the top-middle of the map and channel a wipe. If no bingo is made, use Esther
Innana for safety.
